# Reinforcement-Learning
**Reinforce Model:** A reinforcement learning model that calculates the policy for an agent given a batch of states. It handles the forward pass, computes the loss, and optimizes the model parameters.

**ReinforceWithBaseline Model:** This model is similar to the Reinforce model but includes a baseline estimation of each state's value for comparison with the policy's performance.
